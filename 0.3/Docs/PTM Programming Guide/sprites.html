    <p>Sprites are basically a tile sequence that contains an absolute X and Y position on the screen and can optionally belong to a specific tilebuffer, in which case it will appear inside the owning tilebuffer viewport. Since sprites are just "glorified" tiles, they have the same features as regular tiles, including properties.</p>
    <p>You can create a new sprite using the SPR.NEW command. The SPR.NEW command takes an id parameter which will be used to reference that sprite in other commands. It implicitly takes the contents of the TILE register to define the sprite's tile. The example below shows how to create a new sprite. It assumes that the TILE register has been setup with the appropriate tile data:</p>
    <div class="code">
    SPR.NEW "test"
    </div>
    <p>Notice how the sprite ID is enclosed in double quotes. That is because sprite IDs are regular strings, not literal identifiers. This allows you to store sprite IDs into regular variables and manipulate them using string manipulation, which is useful when storing arrays of sprites (only their IDs are stored in the array).</p>
    <p>Sprites store their own X and Y coordinates internally. You can move sprites around using the commands SPR.POS, SPR.TPOS, SPR.MOVE, SPR.TMOVE, SPR.X, SPR.Y, SPR.TX and SPR.TY.</p>
    <p>SPR.POS is used to set both the X and Y coordinates. If the sprite belongs to a tilebuffer, the coordinates are relative to that tilebuffer's viewport. SPR.X and SPR.Y are used to set the X and Y coordinates individually.</p>
    <p>SPR.TPOS, SPR.TX and SPR.TY are almost the same as SPR.POS, SPR.X and SPR.Y, except that the coordinates get automatically multiplied by 8, which is the tile size. This is useful to snap the sprite to a tilebuffer grid.</p>
    <p>SPR.MOVE and SPR.TMOVE will move the sprite by the specified pixels (SPR.MOVE) or tile units (SPR.TMOVE). Those are relative to the current sprite's position.</p>
    <p>All of the above SPR.* commands take the ID of the sprite as the first parameter.</p>
