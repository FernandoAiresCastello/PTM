    <p>The PTM works with a global color palette with a total of 256 colors. By default, only 2 colors are defined: black (at index 0) and white (at index 1). Palette manipulation can be done via the command PAL. To define colors in the palette, a 24-bit integer value is used to represent the RGB value of the color, usually in hexadecimal notation which makes it easier to identify each component, as seen in the example above, which sets a pure red color at the index 2 of the palette:</p>
    <div class="code">
    PAL 2, &hff0000
