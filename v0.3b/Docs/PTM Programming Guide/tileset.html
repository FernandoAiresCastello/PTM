    <p>The PTM works with a global tileset with a maximum of 65536 tiles. By default, only 256 tiles are defined. Most of these are blank tiles, but some of them are defined as ASCII characters (in the range of 32 through 126). The tileset contains only pixel pattern information, since colors are defined separately in the global palette. Tileset manipulation can be done via the command CHR. To define tiles in the tileset, a 64-character string is used to represent the pixel pattern. Only the characters '1' and '0' are recognized. '1' represents a pixel which will be rendered using the foreground color, '0' represents a pixel which will be rendered using the background color (or not rendered, depending on the command used to actually draw it). The example below defines a "smiley face" at index 1:</p>
    <div class="code">
    CHR 1, "0011110001000010101001011000000110100101100110010100001000111100"
