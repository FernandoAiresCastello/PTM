    <p>If not overriden, the machine starts with a preconfigured window with default dimensions. The command WINDOW is used to override the defaults. The example below will instruct the PTM to open a window with a screen width of 256 pixels and height of 192 pixels. It will also define a "size factor" of 3 which will be used to scale the screen image to fit a larger window. The last parameter indicates that the default tilebuffer will contain 1 layer only (tilebuffers are discussed in their own section further below).</p>
