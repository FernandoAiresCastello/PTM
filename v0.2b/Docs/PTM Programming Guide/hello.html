    <p>Let's start with the most basic program ever, as we usually do when we begin learning any new programming language. PTML is partially inspired by BASIC language dialects for early 8-bit computers. As such, the “Hello World” program in PTML is a very simple one-liner:</p>
    <div class="code">
    PRINT “Hello World!”
    </div>
    <p>When this code is executed, the machine will print the text "Hello World!" (without the quotes) on the window. The double quotes around the text are required since it's a literal string (as opposed to a variable or a number). The position and colors in this example are the machine defaults, since they were not specified.</p>
