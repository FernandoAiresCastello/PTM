    <div class="section-title">Tile Buffers</div>
    <p>Everything that appears on the PTM screen that is not a sprite is associated with a tilebuffer. Tilebuffers (also called simply "buffers") are basically containers for tiles. They have a limited capacity, according to their width, height and number of layers. Width and height are measured in tile units, that is, how many tiles fit in each column and row. Buffers are referenced by their id.</p>
    <p>The PTM automatically creates a default buffer at startup. The default buffer has the id "default" and has a specific size that allows it to cover the entire window. The default buffer has only 1 layer, unless this is overriden via the WINDOW command.</p>
    <p>The command BUF.NEW is used to create new buffers. In the example below, a new buffer is created with the id "test", with 2 layers, 20 columns, 10 rows and at the order 1.</p>
    <div class="code">
    BUF.NEW test, 2, 20, 10, 1
    </div>
    <p>Buffer layers are numbered from 0 through the layer count minus 1. That is, if the buffer contains 3 layers, the layers are numbered 0, 1 and 2. Tiles in higher numbered layers appear on top of lower numbered ones.</p>
    <p>Buffers also have an "order" value which indicates the order in which it appears on the screen among other buffers. Buffers with higher order values appear on top of lower order ones.</p>
    <p>Buffers are displayed on the screen through their own built-in viewport. Viewports define a screen rectangle expressed in pixel units, into which the buffer image will be rendered. Viewports also have a X and Y "scroll" register, which indicate the drawing offset in pixel units. The scroll registers are used for smooth scrolling, when the buffer is too large to fit inside the viewport.</p>
    <p>Viewports are defined using the command BUF.VIEW. In the example below, the viewport rectangle for the buffer "test" is defined at the specified x1, y1, x2, y2 coordinates on the screen:</p>
    <div class="code">
    BUF.VIEW test, x1, y1, x2, y2
    </div>
    <p>The viewport scrolling can be performed by changing the X and Y scroll registers via the command BUF.SCRL, as seen in the example below, where the view is scrolled diagonally by 1 pixel in the top-right direction:</p>
    <div class="code">
    BUF.SCRL test, 1, -1
    </div>
    <p>Buffers cannot be destroyed once created, but they can hidden and later shown again as needed. Hiding a buffer does not destroy its contents. The BUF.SHOW and BUF.HIDE commands can be used to show and hide a buffer. Also, the command BUF.TOGL can be used to alternatively show a buffer if it's hidden or hide a buffer if it's shown. The example below shows how to alter the visibility of the "test" buffer:</p>
    <div class="code">
    BUF.HIDE test
    BUF.SHOW test
    BUF.TOGL test
    </div>
    <p>The rendering of tile buffers is internally managed by the PTM. All visible buffers are drawn automatically by the machine on every frame, upon execution of the UPDATE command.</p>
    <p>Another feature of tile buffers is that they have their own background color. The background color appears in every empty position. An empty position is any position in a buffer that does not contain a tile. The rendering of the buffer background color is enabled by default, but it can be disabled. Disabling the buffer background is useful to allow buffers with lower order value to be visible "through" the empty parts. You can use the command BUF.BGOFF to disable background rendering, or BUF.BCOL to enable it and set the specific color (remember that colors are indices into the color palette, not direct RGB values).</p>
    <div class="code">
    BUF.BGOFF test
    BUF.BCOL 1
    </div>
