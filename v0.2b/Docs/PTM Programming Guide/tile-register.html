    <div class="section-title">The TILE Register</div>
    <p>As a "tile machine", the PTM works mostly with "tiles". Tiles are 8x8 pixel squares that can be used by themselves or to create larger images by "stitching" many tiles together as in a mosaic. As seen in the previous section, the tileset does not contain color information. Colors are assigned to tiles in the TILE register before they are drawn.</p>
    <p>The TILE register is a single, special internal variable that holds a sequence of tile patterns from the tileset along with foreground and background colors. The TILE register contains only indices that reference colors in the global palette and tile patterns in the global tileset. For example, the TILE.NEW command is used to reset the TILE register with new references, as seen below:</p>
    <div class="code">
    TILE.NEW 1, 2, 3
    </div>
    <p>The example above resets the TILE register and assigns to it the tile pattern at index 1 of the tileset, along with the index 2 of the palette for the foreground color, and index 3 of the palette for the background color. Since the TILE register can hold a sequence of tiles, it is possible to add more tiles to it by using the command TILE.ADD, as seen in the example below:</p>
    <div class="code">
    TILE.ADD 2, 2, 3
    TILE.ADD 3, 2, 3
    </div>
    <p>This sequence of tiles can then be implicitly used as input by other commands. For example, they can be drawn on a tilebuffer by using the command PUT. Tilebuffers are discussed in their own section.</p>
    <p>Tiles can also contain arbitrary data, in the form of "properties". Tile properties are simply a collection of name-value pairs, where names must be strings and values can be strings or numbers. You can manipulate tile properties using the commands TILE.SETP and TILE.GETP. Whenever you put or move tiles around in a tilebuffer, their properties go along with them. The example below sets a property "test" with a value of 123 to the tile in the TILE register, and then gets the value from the property "test" into the variable "test_var":</p>
    <div class="code">
    TILE.SETP "test", 123
    TILE.GETP "test", test_var
    </div>
