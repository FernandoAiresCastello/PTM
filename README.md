# PTM - Programmable Tile Machine

## About
	
__PTM (Programmable Tile Machine)__ is a "pseudo-8-bit fantasy computer" that you can program using a built-in programming language called PTML. The system aims to be similar in look-and-feel to some early 8-bit computer systems such as the MSX, ZX Spectrum and Atari 800. Also inspired by the modern game engines Bitsy and PICO-8.

__PTML__ is an interpreted, imperative, semi-structured, loosely typed, low-level programming language, with only two data types: strings and integers. The syntax looks like some early dialects of BASIC and some common assembly languages for 8-bit computers. Familiarity with any of those will probably make it easier to work with PTML, but the language itself is fairly straightforward. In older versions (including the latest release) the PTM executable was the PTML interpreter itself, and code had to be written in plain-text files using an external editor like Notepad. In the latest development version (not yet released), the PTM executable launches an integrated line editor and command-line interface, and the interpreter runs in the same screen as the editor, similar to the Atari 800 BASIC interpreter.

__Note:__ Version __v0.3b__ is no longer being actively developed. Version __v0.4b__ is now the current one, it's a completely new project (developed from scratch) and is drastically different from any previous version. PTML for v0.4b is an almost completely different language, although it shares most of the syntax and simplicity of the previous installments.

*Note: development builds can be *very* unstable since they are being actively worked on and change frequently, so use at your own risk!*
