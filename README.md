# PTM - Programmable Tile Machine

## About
	
__PTM (Programmable Tile Machine)__ is a "pseudo-8-bit fantasy computer" that you can program using a built-in programming language called PTML. The system aims to be similar in look-and-feel to some early 8-bit computer systems such as the MSX, ZX Spectrum and Atari 800. Also inspired by the modern game engines Bitsy and PICO-8.

__PTML__ is an interpreted, imperative, semi-structured, loosely typed, low-level programming language, with only two data types: strings and integers (with support for dynamic arrays of those types). All you need for programming in it is a plain-text editor like Notepad. The syntax looks like some early dialects of BASIC and some common Assembly languages for 8-bit computers. Familiarity with any of those will probably make it easier to work with PTML, but the language itself is fairly straightforward.

## Downloads

The latest released version is __v0.1b.__  
You can download pre-built PTM releases on Itch.io, on this page: https://fernandoairescastello.itch.io/ptm

The latest development build for version __v0.2b__ is available [here](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/PTM/tree/master/v0.2b/Build).  
Note that development builds can be *very* unstable since they are being actively worked on and change frequently, so use at your own risk!
