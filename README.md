# PTM - Programmable Tile Machine

## About
	
__PTM (Programmable Tile Machine)__ is a "pseudo-8-bit fantasy computer" that you can program using a built-in programming language called PTML. The system aims to be similar in look-and-feel to some early 8-bit computer systems such as the MSX, ZX Spectrum and Atari 800. Also inspired by the modern game engines Bitsy and PICO-8.

__PTML__ is an interpreted, imperative, semi-structured, loosely typed, low-level programming language, with only two data types: strings and integers. All you need for programming in it is a plain-text editor like Notepad. The syntax looks like some early dialects of BASIC and some common Assembly languages for 8-bit computers. Familiarity with any of those will probably make it easier to work with PTML, but the language itself is fairly straightforward.

## Releases

The latest released version is __v0.1b.__  
You can find pre-built PTM releases on Itch.io, on this page: https://fernandoairescastello.itch.io/ptm

## Testers needed!

If you'd like to support development of this project, please consider being a tester! At this beta stage, simply by writing demo programs in PTML and tinkering with the machine is enough to uncover subtle bugs that I might have missed, and also ideas for improvements to the language can appear.
