# PTM - Programmable Tile Machine

## About
	
__PTM (Programmable Tile Machine)__ is a "pseudo-8-bit fantasy computer" that you can program using a built-in programming language called PTML. The system aims to be similar in look-and-feel to some early 8-bit, computer systems such as the MSX, ZX Spectrum and Atari 800 with a low-resolution, tile-based display. Also inspired by the modern game engines Bitsy and PICO-8.

__PTML__ is an interpreted, imperative, loosely typed, line-based, low-level programming language, with only two basic data types: strings and integers. The syntax is based on early dialects of BASIC and assembly languages for 8-bit computers. Familiarity with any of those will probably make it easier to learn and work with PTML, but the language itself is designed to be fairly straightforward.

## Version history

This project is currently in early alpha stage. All released versions are to be considered as experimental, but mostly functional.

|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **0.3**     | _In development_ | Current implementation, started from scratch. PTML is an entirely different language from earlier versions. Includes a built-in program editor with immediate mode and also an external IDE for editing code and data. |
| **0.2**     | _July 1, 2023_   | Many PTML improvements and new commands. This version also included a few standalone tools (PTM Studio and PTM Tile Editor) besides the main PTM interpreter. |
