# PTM - Programmable Tile Machine
This is a desktop application for Microsoft Windows which emulates a fantasy computer that deals primarily with 8-bit-style graphical tiles. It also features an embedded IDE that allows developing and executing programs for this machine using a low-level programming language called PTML.

PTM is powered by the following libraries:

- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
- [TileGameLib](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/TileGameToolkit/tree/master/TileGameLibC)
- [CppUtils](https://github.com/FernandoAiresCastello/CppUtils)
- [Microsoft Windows API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/)
- [Base64 by René Nyffenegger](https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/development/Base64/Encoding-and-decoding-base-64-with-cpp)
- [C/C++ Standard Library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp)
