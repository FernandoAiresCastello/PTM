# PTM - Programmable Tile Machine

## About
	
PTM (Programmable Tile Machine) is a "pseudo-8-bit fantasy computer" that you can program using an imperative, semi-structured, low-level programming language called PTML. The system aims to be similar in look-and-feel to some early 8-bit computer systems such as the MSX, ZX Spectrum and Atari 800. Also inspired by the modern game engines Bitsy and PICO-8.
